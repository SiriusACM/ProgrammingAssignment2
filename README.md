### Cache the solve matrix to avoid heavy computing

Should be a square matrix

## makeCacheMatrix

The first function makeCacheMatrix creates a special "matrix", which is really a list containing a function to:
* set the data of the matrix
* get the data of the matrix
* set the data of the solve
* get the data of the solve

## cacheSolve


### Example: Caching the Mean of a Vector

Return the solve matrix cache; Compute it if needeed
